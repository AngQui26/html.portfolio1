<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi everyone, my name is Angelica. I am currently working as a Senior Medical Coder for Optum. My goal is to 
  eventually change into computer programming. I am working 40+ hours a week on my full time job and squeeze in a 
  few hours of studying programming a week so I can eventually make the career change in the next year or two.
</p>

<p>I was born in Jalisco, Mexico, but moved to California when I was 6. I was already learning English when in
  Mexico, but I was not fluent at all, which still made the transition hard on me. I always excelled in school
  academically, but had a hard time with personal relationships.
